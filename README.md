While I can't claim to be an prodigy who started coding at 14, I have always loved all forms of technology. Getting to see the inside of all these devices, the software that defines it, has been a dream come true.

Raised in a household that demanded excellence, my grades were always excellent. That environment made me fear failure, it made failure the exception to avoid. There was no joy to be gained from them, only points to meet a grade quoto. That changed when I started on my programming journey in UIC. I still retained that grade complex, yet failure didn't faze me as much. As a CS student(and a programmer in general) my code would fail countless times before it would eventually succeed. The frustrations of failure brought with it a euphoria when it is overcome. It might be this euphoria that inspires so many coders to continue down their path, despite how incredily dumb these failures make you feel sometimes(I can't the number of times my code failed because of missing ;ü•≤). Point is, coding taught me the joy that comes with failure, as well genuine interest in a class subject.

Now, this is the time I promote my skills! I currently am proficient in C and C++, decent in Python and R, am experienced in both Linux and Windows, along with all the other skills expected of budding professionals(word,powerpoint,etc)

Thank you for tuning in! Don't feel shy in reaching out to chat or request access to anything you needüòÅ
